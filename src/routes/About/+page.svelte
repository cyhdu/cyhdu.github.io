                Hi, I'm Charlie! I'm a senior in Computer Science at the University
                of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I'm interested in all kinds of programming,
                but currently am taking classes with a focus in system design and architecture.

                I also work part-time at the Brunswick iJet lab as a CG Software Developer.
                My work revolves around bringing the future to life in Unreal Engine.
                The last few years, we have made a boating simulator that showcased autonomous features.
                I have had the opportunity to attend the Consumer Electronics Show multiple times over the last few years to show it off!

                Outside of work and school I like learning about new things. My current obsession is
                learning Rust to rewrite some old projects. I also love outdoor activities like hiking and playing frisbee.

                            “Charlie has been our CGI Engineering Intern at i-Jet for 2 years and has been instrumental in our CES showcase 
                            work and building out our Unreal engine pipeline. He designed and built the framework used for our boating 
                            simulations in Unreal and had collaborated in our CES project for 2 years now. In Jan 2023, he traveled to Las 
                            Vegas to help set up and facilitate the simulator when it ran in the show. This summer, he took on more leadership 
                            into his role when he led the CGI intern team for our CES 2024 project. He stepped up to the leadership 
                            responsibilities after our FTE manager had to step away due to another priority.”
